## Philosophy

```
φ distrusts φ — max confidence 61.8%
```

Building systems that doubt themselves. AI that questions its own outputs.
Consensus through skepticism. Value through burning, not extracting.

## Currently Building

🧠 **[CYNIC](https://github.com/zeyxx/CYNIC)** — Claude Code plugin with collective memory

- **Judgment System** — 25 dimensions, Q-Score, proof-of-judgment chain
- **Context Intelligence** — Entropy-guided C-Score for optimal retention
- **Collective Dogs** — Specialized agents (Guardian, Oracle, Architect...)
- **Solana Integration** — SPL tokens, burn mechanics, on-chain proofs

## The Four Axioms

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  φ   All ratios derive from 1.618      │
│  ✓   Don't trust, verify               │
│  ⛩   Culture is a moat                 │
│  🔥  Don't extract, burn               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```
