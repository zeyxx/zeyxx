## The Problem

PumpFun is a casino where the house always wins.

- **KOLs** get paid to promote, dump on followers, zero consequences
- **Devs** pocket creator fees, rug after bonding curve
- **Holders** can't prove conviction, can't verify claims

"Trust me bro" doesn't scale.

## The Optimistic Burn Protocol

**Assume nothing. Verify everything. Burn automatically.**

### Why "Optimistic"?

Like Optimistic Rollups, we assume the system works—but everything is provable.

- **Fees claimed?** → Check the PoH chain
- **Burns executed?** → Check the transactions
- **K-Metric accurate?** → Check wallet histories

Anyone can verify. No one needs to trust.

## The Economics

**Creation, not extraction.**

| Traditional Token | $ASDFASDFA |
|-------------------|------------|
| Dev pockets fees | Fees → automatic burn |
| Inflation rewards stakers | No inflation, pure deflation |
| Trust dev roadmap | Trust math + on-chain proofs |
| KOLs paid to shill | K-Metric exposes paper hands |

**Flywheel:**
```
More activity → More fees → More burns → Less supply → More value → More activity
```
